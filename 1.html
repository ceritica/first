        <p>As time goes by, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_services_technology" target="_blank" title="Internet Services Technology">the technology of internet</a> is developing and directly involved our lives. Without knowing it, we cannot fully understand our social issues which directly affects our lives. Furthermore, studying Coding makes people thinking creative and logical. Also, in the situation that Coding is selected as a essential class for elimentary school, it will be hard time for the parents to communicate with their children if not knowing the system of internet for future. <strong><u>So, I decided to learn the Coding to communicate with society, my future children, and for my satisfaction.</strong></u></p>
